💬 Phase 1: Architecture & Folder Setup

Prompt to give Cursor.ai:

You are a senior full-stack engineer.  
Create a technical architecture plan for an E-Commerce Website that allows users to:
- Explore products
- View product details
- Manage a shopping cart

Tech stack:
- Frontend: React.js with React Router for navigation
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB Atlas

Requirements:
- Clean responsive UI
- State management for cart
- RESTful API between frontend and backend

Deliver:
1. Folder structure (both frontend and backend)
2. Description of each folder’s purpose
3. Data flow between client, server, and database
4. Example architecture diagram (ASCII or markdown)


This gives you:
✅ Technical architecture document
✅ Folder structure to use
✅ Overview diagram you can include in documentation

💬 Phase 2: Frontend (React.js)

Prompt to give Cursor.ai:

Create the React.js frontend for the E-Commerce website based on this architecture:
- Use React Router for navigation
- Components: HomePage, ProductList, ProductDetail, Cart
- Add state management using Context API for cart
- Use a modern responsive design (TailwindCSS or basic CSS)
- Fetch products from backend API endpoints

Include:
1. `App.js` routing setup
2. ProductCard and CartItem components
3. Functions to add/remove items from the cart
4. Axios integration for fetching data from backend


Extra prompt for UI polish:

Improve the UI of the ProductList and ProductDetail pages with a clean modern layout and responsive design using TailwindCSS.

💬 Phase 3: Backend (Node.js + Express.js)

Prompt to give Cursor.ai:

Generate a Node.js + Express.js backend for the e-commerce site.
Functionalities:
- Get all products
- Get product by ID
- Add/remove items to/from cart (simulate cart API)
- Connect to MongoDB Atlas
- Use `mongoose` models for Product and User

Project setup:
- Use `dotenv` for environment variables
- Folder structure: routes, models, controllers, config
- Create sample product seed data for testing


Follow-up prompt:

Add input validation and error handling middleware to the Express backend.

💬 Phase 4: Database Integration

Prompt to give Cursor.ai:

Generate Mongoose models for:
1. Product (name, description, price, image, category)
2. User (name, email, password hash, cart items)
3. Cart (user reference, list of product references with quantity)

Add MongoDB Atlas connection setup in `config/db.js` using environment variables.
Also, add a sample `seed.js` script to populate the database with dummy products.

💬 Phase 5: Documentation and Prompts Collection

Prompt to give Cursor.ai:

Create a README.md for this E-Commerce project including:
1. Project overview and architecture
2. Tech stack used
3. How to set up and run frontend/backend
4. MongoDB connection instructions
5. Example API endpoints
6. Features implemented
7. Future improvements section


Then, gather all the previous prompts you gave Cursor.ai and compile them under “Prompts used for code generation” — this satisfies item #3 in the deliverables
